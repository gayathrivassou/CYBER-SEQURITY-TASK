Network Traffic Capture and Analysis Report
Name: [GAYATHRI V]
Date: [11/8/25]
Tool Used: Wireshark (Windows x64 Installer)
File: task5_capture.pcap

Objective
The purpose of this task was to capture live network packets and identify basic protocols and traffic types using Wireshark.

Procedure
Installed Wireshark along with Npcap on the local system.

Opened Wireshark and selected the active Wi-Fi interface.

Began live packet capture.

Generated network traffic by:

Visiting several websites in a browser.

Pinging google.com using Command Prompt.

Stopped the capture after ~1 minute.

Applied protocol filters (dns, tcp, icmp) to analyze traffic.

Saved the capture as task5_capture.pcap.

Protocols Identified
DNS – Domain Name System queries and responses used to resolve domain names to IP addresses.

TCP – Transmission Control Protocol used for reliable data transfer between systems.

ICMP – Internet Control Message Protocol used for network diagnostics (ping).

HTTPS – Encrypted web traffic for secure communication.

Observations
DNS packets showed requests to resolve domain names such as google.com and example.com.

TCP sessions established connections to remote web servers.

ICMP packets confirmed connectivity during ping tests.

HTTPS traffic contained encrypted payloads, ensuring privacy.
